My 10 File-Sharing Options
=============


There are lists of good sites that it can help when it comes in sharing a file. I have been on the project for years now and we always share ideas through sharing huge information via Internet. My co-workers always had time in uploading and downloading stuff on the Internet, yet sometimes, when files are totally unpredictable and the circumstances like traveling away from home is another problem we shared.

We find out that sharing huge files is not easy as we think, though there are a few tools that may help us - mediaFire, [pay per download](http://dollarupload.com), rapidshare, sahrefile, yousendit, and box. 

Feel free to examine and se as a source of a file-sharing.
